OK, starting to transcribe.
I don't remember what I was talking about yesterday.
Talk about health.
When I was little, my mother was always sick.
She had asthma.
Also had asthma.
And both overweight.
I was the skinny one.
I played sports. I was in good shape.
My brother, not so much.
Has to do with.
At the right times.
